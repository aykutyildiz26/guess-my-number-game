# Guess My Number

This is a simple "Guess My Number" game built with React Native. The player thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and the app tries to guess the number. The player provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and the app adjusts its guesses accordingly. The game ends when the app correctly guesses the number and displays the number of attempts it took.
